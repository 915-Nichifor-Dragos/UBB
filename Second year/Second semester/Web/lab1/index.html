        <h2> Carbon capture: What is it and how does it fight climate change? </h2>
        The UK government is set to announce where a ground-breaking power station will be built. <br>
        The carbon capture plant is designed to <b>stop</b> most of the carbon dioxide (CO2) it produces being released into the atmosphere. <br><br>
        How does carbon capture work?
        <ul>
            <li> Burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits CO2, which is the main driver of climate change. </li>
            <li> The carbon capture process stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either re-uses it or stores it underground. </li>
            <li> The UK government wants a new power station where carbon dioxide is captured and stored under the North Sea - either in old oil and gas reservoirs, or permeable rocks known as saline aquifers. </li>
        </ul>
        <aside>
            Exposure to CO2 can produce a variety of health effects. These may include headaches, dizziness, restlessness, a tingling or pins or needles feeling, difficulty breathing, sweating, tiredness, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, coma, asphyxia, and convulsions.
